      <p>Hello, my name is Antony! I am a handsome gentleman in his mid forties that is attempting to learn how to code. It has been while since I have attempted to code in HTML, the last time I tried HTML was still in 2.0 and everybody was going ga ga over Macromedia Dreamweaver. Basically, I'm old! But it doesn't mean that I am not young at heart.</p>
      <p>Anyhoo, I am learning a lot from this course and I find the instructors are very imformative. In doing this assignment, I have learned a lot about the changes that have been implented in HTML since the days when I played with it. For example, I had no idea about the nav and article tags. And my girlfriend shamed me for attempting to use inline styling. How embarassing!</p>
      <p>But now, thanks to this bootcamp, I am no longer so clueless. With my newfound knowledge, I hope to land a sweet gig during my twighlight years coding and devloping games, as well as applying the concepts of gameifaction to many aspects in our daily lives. I strive to one day run a company that produces games designed for people that most of the big gaming companies are overlooking, as well as exploring new facets in software development.</p>
      <p>In addition to my coding, I have many other interests. I collect vinyl records, and I watch a lot of soccer on TV, mostly Liga MX, MLS, and Bundesliga. I also really enjoy bad old VHS movies, as well as classic 80's anime. I also enjoy gardening and I grow my own herbs and vegetables. Finally, of course, I play a lot of videogames for inspiration, kitbashing ideas, and of course for enjoyment and distraction.</p>
